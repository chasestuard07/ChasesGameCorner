                Hi! Welcome to my game site. This is my first website, and features three bite-sized games, as well as several pages.
                My objective with these games is to learn Javascript, a programming language commonly used for web applications and websites. 
                Building websites also includes HTML and CSS, which are both implemented into this website, as well as my own portfolio *coming soon*.
                I hope you enjoy exploring this small project!
