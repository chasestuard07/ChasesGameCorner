            Hi! Welcome to my game site. Here, I keep all of my games (made in vanilla Javascript), organized by waves. Each wave follows a theme, and has two to four games.
            My objective with these games is to learn Javascript, a programming language commonly used for web applications and websites. 
            Building websites also includes HTML and CSS, which are both implemented into this website, as well as my own portfolio: (insert portfolio link here).
            I hope you enjoy exploring my various projects!   
        </p>
